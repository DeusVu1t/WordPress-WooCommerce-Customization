WordPress WooCommerce Customization


Description:
This GitHub repository showcases one of my recent projects as of November 3, 2023. The project involves extensive customization of WooCommerce, a popular WordPress e-commerce plugin. Key modifications include:

1. Product Configuration: Implemented a custom product configuration feature that allows customers to choose cake flavors, sizes, and decorations. Prices are adjusted dynamically based on customer selections. Admins can view customer choices and their associated prices in the CMS.

2. Custom Cake Form: Created a custom form for customers to configure and request prices for custom cakes. The form is built using Contact Form 7.

This project marks my first venture into such customizations, and I am proud to say that I have met the client's requirements effectively. The changes provide a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience.

Feel free to adjust the description to your preferences, and best of luck with your GitHub project!
